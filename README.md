## Important Environment Variables
```shell
## ENV VARIABLES ##
LD_LIBRARY_PATH      # LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable you set to give the run-time shared library loader (ld.so)
                     # an extra set of directories to look for when searching for shared libraries.
                     # This list is prepended to the existing list of compiled-in loader paths for a given executable, and any system default loader paths.
                     # For security reasons, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored at runtime for executables that have their setuid or setgid bit set.
                     # This severely limits the usefulness of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
HOME                 # Contains the path to the home directory of the current user
PATH                 # Contains a colon-separated list of directories in which your system looks for executable files
```
